Even deciding what you want to test and then figuring out how to test it can require more work than I expected. I enjoyed learning about a range of testing techniques that can fit into any situation needed. Readings I found particularly useful were about being flexible in your <a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/17697907/HCDE/HCDE517/Readings/dray_penny_wise_pound_wise.pdf\">testing plan and recruiting</a>, even for <a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/17697907/HCDE/HCDE517/Readings/krug_10_cents_a_day.pdf\">cheap</a>. Basically, <em>any</em> testing is better than <em>no</em> testing.<br /><br />			I am already starting to apply what I have learned in this class at my day job. Traditionally at my company, nearly all user testing has been performed using prerelease users via forums. With my current project, I am working with our team's designer to design and run ono-on-one tests and observations with users. We have been recruiting and have performed a couple testing sessions so far. It has really shown the rest of my team how valuable this type of testing can be.</p>"

				"content": "<p>For our group project, we worked with <a href=\"http://squarehub.com\">Squarehub</a> to evaluate their new iPhone application. They wanted to verify that users would not have problems with the registration process. Since they had a couple different versions with workflow variations, we decided to run a comparison test between the two. We also decided to test the calendar event system after determining it was important but not very useful in its current implementation.<br/><br/>After our testing, we were able to confirm that their latest registration process does work without major issues. We even found that part of their original process tested even better than the new version, so we recommended they use that part in their final product to make the new process even better. For the calendar, we were able to provide data from users that the calendar functionality is essential to them using the app. From our data, we also gave a couple fairly small recommendations to quickly increase its usefulness.<br/><br/>Our collaboration process was not as smooth as I would have liked, but overall we were successful. We attempted to do most of the group work using <a href=\"http://drive.google.com\">Google Drive</a>, but not everyone was comfortable with this, and the formatting with charts in text documents currently leaves a lot to be desired. Ultimately we used Office for most of our documents and shared them via email. We did use Google Hangouts for many of our discussions as we were not collocated, and they proved very useful and productive.<br/><br/>Overall, I think our project was definitely a success, and I hope Squarehub will use our findings to improve their product!</p>"

				"content": "<p>Overall, I think our group evenly split all the group work. I do not feel that anyone did not do their fair part. We all had our natural strengths, but we all were also willing to work in areas that we were not strong in. Specifically for me:<ul><li>I was often a final proofreader of all the assignments</li><li>I helped narrow our testing focus on the calendar and created the task plan for testing it</li><li>I ran the Morae system and observed during the testing sessions</li><li>I worked on the registration comparison data analysis, ultimately choosing the <a href=\"http://www.measuringusability.com/SUM/index.htm\">SUM method</a></li><li>I gave the presentation on our findings and recommendations to the class</li></ul><br/><br/>One of our biggest challenges was being in separate locations as we could not meet in person at any time, so we had to use video chats and utilize class work time as much as possible. Another was collaborating on the same document files, which we never quite got running smoothly. One of our biggest successes was providing Squarehub with not only useful information about their registration that they requested, but also on the calendar functionality and its importance to users.</p>"
